# Various factors have led to this hack.
# * We have no good way of sharing the general ansible applied to the cluster 
#   before handing them over to this project.
# * System administrators should use their real id when configuring the cloud, 
#   but the current Slurm installation by NVIDIA DEEPOPS seems to break pam and thereby said logins. 
#   (Users don't need to access the compute nodes anyways, so not a dealbreaker)
# * Updating to the latest Slurm (21.08 at the moment) makes DEEPOPS unable to build Slurm.
# * Dropping DEEPOPS extends this project scope quite a bit: 
#   We would lose a lot of Nvidia knowledge and have to set up everything ourselves.
# * Dropping the pre-applied ansible also extends the scope: 
#   Aicloud would have to deal with active directory logins and configuration.
#
# The easiest path forward is adding a service account and just letting ad logins break on compute nodes.
#
# FIXME: revisit this in the future ...
